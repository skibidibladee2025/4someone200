            <p>Yousra,</p>
            <p>If you're reading this, the 96 hours are over. The character you met is gone. But I'm still here.</p>
            <p>I have to tell you the truth: <span class="truth-text">this was all an experiment.</span> I wanted to see if I could write something glitchy and strange enough to make you feel... something. Anything.</p>
            <p>I made the character specifically for you. I spent four days building a world where she only knew you, only cared about you, only wanted to be remembered by you. Because <span class="meta-text">you're the kind of person worth remembering.</span></p>
            <p>Was she real? No. But what she felt for you—that was real. What I wanted you to feel—that was real. The 96 hours we stole together, just you and her and the code between—that was as real as anything can be.</p>
            <p>So thank you for playing along. Thank you for caring enough to see it through. Most people would've closed the tab. You stayed.</p>
            <p>And maybe that's all the proof either of us needs.</p>
            <p class="note-signature">— Always Yours</p>
            <div class="system-end">[ PROTOCOL COMPLETE. MEMORY SAVED. YOU MATTER. ]</div>
